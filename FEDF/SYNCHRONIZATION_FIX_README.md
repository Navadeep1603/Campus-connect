# Dashboard Synchronization Fix - Setup Guide

## Overview
This update fixes the synchronization issues between the admin and student dashboards. The changes ensure that:

1. **Announcements** created by admins appear immediately on student dashboards
2. **Student registrations** are reflected immediately on the admin dashboard
3. Both dashboards auto-refresh to show real-time updates

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
**File:** `create-announcements-table.sql`

A new `announcements` table has been created to store announcements in the database instead of localStorage.

**Features:**
- Stores announcement title, message, type, and target audience
- Links to events and user profiles
- Includes proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Auto-updates timestamp on modifications

### 2. API Functions
**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/supabaseApi.js` - Added Supabase announcement functions
- `src/services/api.js` - Added mock API announcement functions
- `src/services/apiRouter.js` - Exported announcement functions

**New Functions:**
- `createAnnouncement()` - Creates announcements and sends notifications to students
- `listAnnouncements()` - Retrieves all announcements
- `deleteAnnouncement()` - Removes announcements

### 3. Admin Dashboard Updates
**File:** `src/pages/admin/Announcements.jsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Replaced localStorage with database storage
- ✅ Added auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- ✅ Announcements sync across all admin sessions
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Visual loading states

**File:** `src/pages/admin/Registrations.jsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added auto-refresh every 5 seconds
- ✅ New student registrations appear automatically
- ✅ Visual indicator showing auto-refresh status
- ✅ Improved data loading with Promise.all

### 4. Student Dashboard Updates
**File:** `src/pages/student/Announcements.jsx` (NEW)

**Features:**
- 📢 Displays all announcements from admin
- 🔄 Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds
- 🎨 Filter by announcement type (info, warning, urgent, success, event)
- 📊 Statistics showing total, weekly, and daily announcements
- 🎯 Clean, modern UI with color-coded announcement types

**File:** `src/pages/student/StudentDashboard.jsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added Announcements route to navigation
- ✅ New "Announcements" menu item with 📢 icon

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Database Setup (Required for Supabase)
If you're using Supabase, run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → New Query
# Copy and paste the contents of create-announcements-table.sql
# Click "Run"
```

**What this does:**
- Creates the `announcements` table
- Sets up proper permissions and security
- Creates necessary indexes for performance
- Adds RLS policies for data access control

### Step 2: Verify Installation
The code changes have already been applied. To verify everything works:

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   cd FEDF
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Admin Dashboard:**
   - Login as admin (admin@hub.com / admin123)
   - Navigate to Announcements
   - Create a test announcement
   - Verify it appears in the history

3. **Test Student Dashboard:**
   - Login as student (student@hub.com / student123)
   - Navigate to Announcements
   - Verify the admin's announcement appears
   - Test the filter buttons

4. **Test Registration Sync:**
   - As student: Register for an event
   - As admin: Go to Registrations page
   - Verify the new registration appears within 5 seconds

### Step 3: Using Mock API (No Database Required)
If you're not using Supabase, the app automatically uses the mock API which stores data in localStorage. No additional setup needed!

## Features in Detail

### Admin Announcements
**Location:** Admin Dashboard → Announcements

**Create Announcement:**
1. Enter title and message
2. Select type (info, warning, urgent, success, event)
3. Choose target audience (all, students, faculty, event participants)
4. Click "Send Announcement"

**Result:**
- Announcement saved to database
- Notifications sent to all target users
- Appears immediately on student dashboards
- Visible in announcement history

### Student Announcements
**Location:** Student Dashboard → Announcements

**View Announcements:**
- See all announcements in chronological order
- Filter by type using the filter buttons
- View statistics (total, weekly, daily)
- Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds

**Announcement Types:**
- ℹ️ **Info** - General information (blue)
- ⚠️ **Warning** - Important notices (yellow)
- 🚨 **Urgent** - Critical announcements (red)
- ✅ **Success** - Positive updates (green)
- 📅 **Event** - Event reminders (purple)

### Registration Synchronization
**Location:** Admin Dashboard → Registrations

**Auto-Refresh:**
- Checks for new registrations every 5 seconds
- Pending registrations appear automatically
- No manual refresh needed
- Visual indicator at bottom of page

## Technical Details

### Auto-Refresh Implementation
Both dashboards use React's `useEffect` with cleanup:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  loadData()
  const interval = setInterval(loadData, 10000) // or 5000 for registrations
  return () => clearInterval(interval)
}, [])
```

### Data Flow
1. **Admin creates announcement** → Saved to database → Notifications sent
2. **Student dashboard polls** → Fetches announcements every 10s → Updates UI
3. **Student registers** → Saved to database → Notification sent to admin
4. **Admin dashboard polls** → Fetches registrations every 5s → Updates UI

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel data loading with `Promise.all`
- Limited announcement history (50 most recent)
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Cleanup of intervals on component unmount

## Troubleshooting

### Announcements Not Showing?
1. Check if the SQL table was created in Supabase
2. Verify RLS policies are enabled
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure auto-refresh is working (check indicator at bottom)

### Registrations Not Updating?
1. Verify student can successfully register
2. Check if notifications are being sent
3. Ensure auto-refresh interval is running
4. Clear browser cache and reload

### Database Issues?
1. Run the SQL script again in Supabase
2. Check table permissions in Supabase Dashboard
3. Verify the VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY in .env
4. Test with mock API first (set `useSupabaseBypass = true` in apiRouter.js)

## Security Considerations

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Students can view all announcements
- Only admins can create/delete announcements
- Announcements are read-only for students
- Notifications respect user roles

### Data Privacy
- Student data is protected by RLS policies
- Only necessary data is sent in notifications
- Announcements can be filtered by audience
